      <h2>Here's the highlights of Gary Snyder's life:</h2>
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - May 8, Gary Sherman Snyder was born in San Francisco, California to Harold and Lois Hennessy Snyder;</li><br>
      <li><strong>1951</strong> - He graduated with a dual degree in anthropology and literature. Snyder's senior thesis, entitled The Dimensions of a Myth, employed perspectives from anthropology, folklore, psychology, and literature to examine a myth of the Pacific Northwest's Haida people;</li><br>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - He spent some months in 1955 and 1956 living in a cabin (which he dubbed "Marin-an") outside Mill Valley, California with Jack Kerouac. It was also at this time that Snyder was an occasional student at the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Sabur≈ç Hasegawa and Alan Watts, among others, were teaching. Hasegawa introduced Snyder to the treatment of landscape painting as a meditative practice.</li><br> 
      <li><strong>1966</strong> - Snyder joined Allen Ginsberg, Zentatsu Richard Baker, Roshi of the San Francisco Zen Center, and Donald Walters, a.k.a. "Swami Kriyananda," to buy 100 acres (0.40 km2) in the Sierra foothills, north of Nevada City, California.</li><br> 
      <li><strong>1971</strong> - Gary and his wife Masa Uehara, moved to the San Juan Ridge in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada of Northern California, near the South Yuba River, where they and friends built a house that drew on rural-Japanese and Native-American architectural ideas.</li><br>
      <li><strong>1975</strong> - Gary Snyder won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for <em>Turtle Island</em>.</li><br>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - Snyder became a professor in the writing program at the University of California, Davis. Snyder is now professor emeritus of English.</li><br>
      <li><strong>1996</strong> - He published the complete <em>Mountains and Rivers Without End</em>, a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese, French and Russian.</li> <br>
      <li><strong>2004</strong> -  Snyder published <em>Danger on Peaks</em>, his first collection of new poems in twenty years.</li> <br>
      <li><strong>2010</strong> - Snyder's life and work was celebrated in John J. Healy's documentary <em>The Practice of the Wild</em>. The film, which debuted at the 53rd San Francisco International Film Festival, features wide-ranging, running conversations between Snyder and poet, writer and longtime colleague Jim Harrison, filmed mostly on the Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, California. The film also shows archival photographs and film of Snyder's life.</li> <br>

    <div id="poem"><h4><em>POEM LEFT IN SOUGHDOUGH MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT</h4>
I the poet Gary Snyder<br>
Stayed six weeks in fifty-three<br>
On this ridge and on this rock<br>
& saw what every Lookout sees,<br>
Saw these mountains shift about<br>
& end up on the ocean floor<br>
Saw the wind and waters break<br>
The branched deer, the Eagle's eye,<br>
& when pray tell, shall Lookouts die?<br>

    (A later lookout told me this poem was still pinned up in the cabin in 1968)</em>
